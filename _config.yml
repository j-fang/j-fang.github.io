# Site settings

  I’ve put off writing this blog for years. 
  Because I've been stressing over making myself sound like I know my stuff.
  But I'm not perfect.
  I'm trialing through life, just as everybody else is. 
  And I’m trying to embrace this by 
  finally just doing what I’ve been wanting to do: 
  practice processing my thoughts through written words, unfiltered.
