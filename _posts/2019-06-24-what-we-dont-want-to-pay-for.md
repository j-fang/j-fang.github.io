I found a book club at [BookPeople][BookPeople] called [Well Read Black Girl][WRBG]. I got a vibe 
that this book club would touch upon female empowerment, which I'm a huge advocate for.

They had their meeting today, and the book of choice for this meeting is "The Source of Self-Regard" by Toni Morrison. I've heard her name mentioned a few times in my life, so I recognized it as a "big" name. 

When I started reading this book two days before the book club meeting, I did not expect something
so dense. I had to reread almost every paragraph a few times to really just understand what the words were. The meaning sunk in sometimes, and sometimes not. It didn't help that I had things on my mind, which kept distracting me from Toni's words. (Aside: did you know her Chloe? [Chloe Anthony Wofford][CAW].)

For the small nuggets that did penetrate the depths of my brain, I did get a small glimpse of Toni's brilliance, the truths she speaks of that is so relevant to the societal problems we see today. And I was conflicted. How can the work of such an incredibly smart woman be so inaccessible to everyday people? 

Hear me out before you jump to conclusions about that question. Let me unpack that first. I didn't get to finish the book as I tried to cram as much as I could before the book club meeting. FYI, cramming is a very poor method to read this book and to retain and understand meaning and messages that Toni conveys through her words. In the quick glimpses of the gems of Toni's words, my mind was like, "Wow, that is so true. I wish more people could read this and understand it from Toni's perspective." Yet, I knew that I am not representative of the general young population. Most people my age would not spend the time to read this book nor choose it over another probably. A major part of it is because it's not an easy read. How can this book be made more accessible to "everyday" people? It's not fair for Toni to have to change her language, change her way of expression to appease "everyday" people, especially when even if it were an easy read, I don't know if that many people would or could appreciate Toni's words. But that's one question that I had coming into the book club meeting: where is the balance in maintaining an author's authenticity of their words and making that authenticity accessible to people? I didn't have an answer and didn't know how to think about it.

**My takeaway**

A couple attendees attempted to address my question. From their responses, I learned, realized, and have now come to believe that it's not the author or artist's responsbility to compromise their work to engage a larger population of people. It's the reader's responsibility to appreciate the artists' work and efforts. 

Here is an analogy that someone said which effectively captures this idea. An author and artist (authors are also artists) will work their butt off climbing up the mountain (producing their works of art). They welcome you up the mountain (by sharing their works through books, music, poetry, paintings, photography, and many more forms of art) to join them (to learn from another's point of view), but it is NOT the author's responsibility to pull you up the mountain to get to the top (compromising or unnecessarily simplifying their work to satisfy others). It is your responsibility as a reader to do your part and get up there yourself. Of course, there is some balance of writing in a way that captures a reader's attention, but that's besides the point of this lesson I learned today.

**Reflection**

It's not meant to be easy for a reader. And I think that's a lesson I didn't learn well in school.
Middle and high school was all about getting the themes and summaries through CliffNotes, because 
"I had no idea" what the deeper meaning of this book is about. I never challenged myself to think
harder, to spend the time pondering an idea for longer timeframes, to revisit words and text and
see them with a refreshed perspective. I conditioned myself to be spoonfed. I feel kind of 
ashamed and embarrassed about it now. 

This idea of working to meet an author where they're at (in this mountain journey) extends to other artists too. Books, instrumental music, paintings, choreography, photographs, sculptures, singing, plays, operas. (These are just some examples.) I've been guilty of thinking, this book costs $30, what!? This ticket costs $500!? No way am I paying for this. Yet, people are willing to pay $900 for a new phone, thousands of dollars for a new computer. I'm guilty of it (the latter, not the former. I will not pay more than $400 for a phone as of now. Who knows though, I may give in in a few years...I hope not. :P)

There are valid reasons why technology costs more and people are more willing to pay for them. But
the main idea I'm getting at here is the society I've grown up in has conditioned me to believe in values that are misaligned. 

We don't recognize the struggles, the emotions, the hardship that comes with writing and creating. It's not easy!! (Let's be real, I could never drop an album like Beyonce or even write a children's song for a TV show like Sesame Street or Blue's Clues). And this is partially due to the way media portrays people and how often they talk about success stories over people's imperfect and difficult road to "success". Many of us don't understand the sweat, tears, and challenges that artists face and overcome.

**A challenge to myself**

So here I am now, thinking about what I can do about it.
1. I'm going to give "The Source of Self-Regard" another several attempts. It's a book you gotta read and reread many more than several more times to extract all the nuggets of wisdom from.
2. If I ever encounter a difficult book to read, I will pause, recognize that, and not give up trying to read it.
3. Next time I engage with art through whatever medium (listening, seeing, touching, doing), I'm going to try to think about the artists and what they could have gone through to create that piece. Whether it's good or bad art, it's often not an easy thing to do. I'm going to intentionally spend a moment to recognize someone for their efforts to produce something new. And if I think it's real good and worth keeping a copy of, I will support them as directly as I can (e.g. local bookstore > Amazon. I can also afford it right now. Compensation as a PM at a well-reputed tech company is higher than I ever expected to earn myself). We need more people trying to do something as opposed to nothing. I also believe that the world will benefit with more cultural and art appreciation.
