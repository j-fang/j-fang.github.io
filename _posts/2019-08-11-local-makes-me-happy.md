I just got back from a trip to [Wheatsville Food Co-op][WFC], and I'm super happy right now.

**Reason for trip**

I cooked a bulk pot of pink rice that I got from Wheatsville a week ago when it was on sale (#trynewfoodwhenitsonsale). I overestimated and made like 10 meals' worth of rice, when I was aiming for 4-5. I store the rice in fridge, which is fine except the rice dries out. So, to compensate for the dryness, I know I need to cook saucy veggies. So my goal of this trip was to get a jar of sauce under $5, probably a curry-like sauce.

**Reasons for why I'm super happy**
* I slept in til 10:30am. Although I did sleep at 2am-ish, I felt like I finally got the sleep I needed.
* A cointern introduced me to the field of healthcare technology and I've been starting to read and learn about the industry through the lens of disruptive innovation. I'm in the state where I just found a new interest and am super excited about understanding it. There's so many tabs on my computer right now, and I just requested about 10 books from my college to read (upon my return in 2 weeks!). 
* I like my outfit today, and I feel good in it. It's just a simple colorful dress, my Birkenstocks, + my trusty grocery tote bag.
* It's sunny outside, so that raised my vitamin D levels, as I made my bus adventure over to Wheatsville.
* Wheatsville has a compost bin. I collect my compost until I make a trip to a grocery store with composting or my compost containers are all full, so I finally got to empty my containers after 2 weeks! People have noted that my collection of compost and disposal process seems very extra; call it what you will. I am proud to divert ~95% of my waste from the landfill. Composting ensures my food scraps get recycled into nutrients for soil. Landfilling waste ensures more methane is released into the atmosphere, thereby worsening climate change. (Landfills are so compact with trash that anaerobic decomposition occurs, which produces methane as a byproduct. Methane, btw, is 34x worse than CO2 in warming effect.)
* Wheatsville has free food samples. I love food, and I love good free food.
* Wheatsville also had organic peaches on sale: $1.99/lb. A month or two ago, it was $2.49/lb at Whole Foods (and that was considered on sale). These peaches were pretty soft and ripe, so I'm guessing it's due to an abundant supply. Regardless, #yayseasonalfruits and yay for on sale organic produce. I had a realization yesterday. I've been craving sweets for the past two weeks, and have turned towards eating a lots of granola bars at work, which has a bunch of added sugar. Yesterday, I went to the farmers' market and got a locally grown organic korean melon for $2! (Has like 6-ish servings worth?) A korean melon, as described to me and I can now confirm having ate it, is a fruit like a watermelon but with a firmer texture like an apple. (The skin can also be eaten, it tastes fine to me!) Anyways, I realized I haven't eaten real fruit in like 2 weeks. In the beginning of my summer, I would eat a bunch of fruits (e.g. blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, peaches, nectarines, pluots) to satisfy my sweet tooth and ate nothing with added sugars for a whole month. Then that streak broke down. Me not buying fruits was partially 1) Austin farmers' markets don't have many fruit offerings, and 0 that are organic 2) I didn't want to buy fruits from Whole Foods cause I don't want to support Amazon and 3) not needing to go to grocery stores to buy anything else. After eating my korean melon, I realized that I need more real fresh fruit in my diet ([real fruit > sugary sweets][sugar]). So I was real happy to bought a bunch of peaches on sale.
* Grocery shopping is my favorite type of shopping, so just being in a grocery store lifted my mood.
* I found a coconut curry sauce within my budget. Plus, it's in a reusable glass jar!
* Wheatsville is a special place; it embodies and practices environmental and social stewardship in ways I wish more grocery stores would do. Wherever I live, I want to have a Wheatville-like grocery store near me. If there isn't one, I want to start one.

    1. They offer [EO hand sanitizer][EO] instead of convetional brands like Purcell. 
    2. They offer compostable bags over plastic. 
    3. They support and stock a lot of local brands and label them. Supporting local is important in boosting the local economy. Buying local means more money you spend remains in your community because local businesses tend to support local vendors as well, contributing towards increasing more local jobs and supporting local distribution and processing systems.
    4. They use non-plastic (paper) sample cups.
    5. They have a bulk section which is where I get all my grains and legumes. I love that they have bulk peanut butter.
    6. They have weekly sales that make shopping local and organic more affordable. They also have what basic staples priced at affordable price points.
    7. Their bakery makes their pastries and breads look so freaking delicious and wholesome.
    8. Their housemade desserts, pastries, and breads are made with unenriched and unbleached flours (read about what's problematic with enriched and bleached flour [here][flour]). They're also not filled with a ton of additives, preservatives, and added sugars, as I see in Whole Foods' baked goods.
    9. They support local non-profits by offering customers to round up their total to nearest dollar to donate to a different non-profit each month.
    10. They ask me if I want my receipt. I always refuse, and they don't print it out. Unlike Whole Foods, where even if I say no, it's printed out and thrown into the trash; what a freaking waste. I don't take receipts because 1) I don't need it. If I do, I just take photo of the computer screen. 2) 94% of receipts are lined with BPA and BPS, which are endocrine disruptors. (Read more about impact of receipts [here][receipts].) I don't know if Wheatsville's receipts are lined with BPA or not, cause I've never taken one. 
    11. It holds so many brands that I love and also has introduced me to brands I was previously unfamiliar with that are very mindful of their environmental and social impact. 
    12. There are definitely more reasons why I love Wheatsville and local independent grocery stores, but these are the reasons that were on the top of my mind today.

* I came back to make lunch, and very pleased with my [Goan curry by Maya Kaimal][curry]. 
* I am also very proud of how far I've come with cooking. My palate and cooking skills have changed. I make veggie stir fries that have satisfied my appetite and taste buds. (Btw, I learned how to steam beet, and am uber proud that I can cook beets now.) Next goal is to learn how to make my own sauces and I'll be set to make any dish incredibly tasty (to me, at least).

Overall, it's what Wheatsville stands for, my enjoyment and appreciation of their values and practices, and this realization during my experience in their store today that made me happy, and I just had to share. :)
