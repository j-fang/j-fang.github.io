Note: This is a rant.

How are you?

What kind of answer do you expect to hear from this? Do you actually care how I am? People have literally asked me this while smiling and walking away… I’m thinking, why did you waste your breath? You make yourself think you’re being nice by asking, but you’re really not. 


Also, at work, people will ask me how I am. I saw you yesterday. You know just as well as I do that we both woke up in the last hour or two, went through our morning routine, and came to work. There’s not much to my day so far, and I'm just 'good' or 'okay'. (hahaha, those are my usual go-to answers. They hold validity though. If I'm feeling 'good' I say so. If I'm not feeling above average, then I go with 'okay'.)


And if I were actually doing bad, do you think asking me how I am will invite me to divulge the emotions and thoughts that consume my mind? Do you even want that? 


I know I’m looking really deep into this, but hey, it entertains me right now. All this is to say, I’m not about this common form of greeting. Just say hi, smile and let’s move on with our day. If you really care about me and want to know more, ask me a more specific question and ask follow up questions. 


Thank you. :)
