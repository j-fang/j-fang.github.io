I discovered the Austin bus system!! Now my exploration zone has expanded by a 5 mile radius. I'm so freaking excited and happy about this. 

Previously, I walked everywhere, and I enjoyed it; it's how I travel and discover new places when I am in a new city. I'm willing to walk 40 minutes to get to a destination, given time permits. However, in the first few weeks I've been here, I kind of maxed out seeing all that I am interested in the Austin West Campus and downtown area, given the heat and humidity of the summer. I also adventured a bit of East Austin and South Congress. 

I don't like taking Ubers or Lyfts because 1) I'm frugal and don't like spending so much money on transportation and 2) I don't like traveling with car. I don't see or experience much of a new place that way. 

With the bus, it's $2.50 for a 24 hour pass, and it will take me close to any destination I've wanted to go to so far. They have an app that makes it super convenient to purchase and use tickets. Google Maps has been immensely helpful in figuring out what buses to take and how to get to location X. 

The bus has enabled me to: 

1) stroll through the Barton Creek Greenbelt trails (to spend some time in nature and outdoors)

2) shop leisurely through Burnet Road (and discover Wheatesville Coop, a local grocery store that I am excited to now support)

3) shorten my morning farmers' market trips, and

4) venture through S Lamar where there are many yummy restaurants that I want to try out one day. 

More Austin adventures await :)
