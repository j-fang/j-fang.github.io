I know I'm talking about food again, but I just LOVE food. 

This semester:
* I'm working with [Known & Grown](http://knownandgrownstl.org/) to connect chefs to local (within 150 miles of St. Louis) farmers practicing regenerative agriculture to build a stronger local food system
* I'm taking a Mexican Food Culture class, learning about the history and development of Mexican gastronomy
* I've been on a reading binge of recipe and cookbooks, such as [Zaitoun](http://yasminkhanstories.com/portfolio-item/zaitoun/)) and [The Saffron Tales](http://yasminkhanstories.com/portfolio-item/the-saffron-tales/) by [Yasmin Khan](http://yasminkhanstories.com/#section-books) and [Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/) by [Samin Nosrat](https://ciaosamin.com/)
* I just compeleted a [Whole30 cleanse](https://whole30.com/) with a friend. 

A combination of all the above has me experimenting more in the kitchen and exploring more of what St. Louis has to offer. I'm going to be in LA for [Expo West](https://www.expowest.com/en/home.html) and taking my friend home with me for spring break, so more food is to come. My fam is coming for my graduation and we're extending their trip into a post-grad fam adventure to Chicago and New York. And with that, comes me looking at more food.

Basically, I love food and I've been exploring what I love this semester.

As I've been thinking about where and what I want to show my friend when I take her home for spring break, I started drafting up a list of places that I love to eat at and wholeheartedly recommend to others. The list expanded to account for all the places I've been to in the world that are memorable for me and freaking delicious, so here's to sharing and celebrating the good foods!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I attempted to follow a general format of:
**Name of place**, location -- what I've eaten here/what's good; *why this made it on the list*

**Tried and tested** (USA, ordered alphabetically by city name):
* **[Xian Sushi & Noodles][xian]**, Austin, TX, USA -- Chinese noodles; **affordable noodles, satisfies Chinese flavor cravings**
* **[Chi’lantro][chilantro]**, Austin, TX, USA -- build your own; **affordable, filling, good flavors, quick meal**
* **[Arpeggio Grill][arpeggio]**, Austin, TX, USA -- vegetarian mesa platter, grilled fish platter; **everything was super flavorful, filling, affordable**
* **[A la minute][alaminute]**, Claremont, CA, USA -- liquid nitrogen ice cream; **really fresh flavors**
* **[Wild Flour Bread][wild flour]**, Freestone, CA, USA -- organic bread; **organic garden, tasty, fresh**
* **[Napoleon Bakery][napoleon]**, Oakland, CA, USA -- Chinese egg tarts, buns, baos; **cheap to your hearts’ content, local, authentic**
* **[Ruby King’s Bakery][ruby]**, Oakland, CA, USA -- Chinese wife cakes, mooncakes; **local, authentic**
* **[The Vine Mediterranean Cafe][vine]**, St. Louis, MO, USA -- munazula; **affordable, tasty, filling**
* **[Mission Taco][mission taco]**, St. Louis, MO, USA -- $2 tacos; **go for the vibe**
* **[Ashirwad][ashirwad]**, Upland, CA, USA -- I love me the thali, vada paav, palak paneer (but tbh, you can’t go wrong with anything here, unless you don’t like a particular Indian flavor); **authentic Indian food**


**Not in USA:**
* **Eat Indian mother or grandma's homecooking**
* Some **vegan afternoon tea**, London -- my friend and I stumbled upon it, had outside seating with bees attracted to the honey for our sconces; **not too sweet, a very pleasant experience**
* **[Jacinta y María Chocolates][jacinta]**, Toledo, Spain -- ice cream y mazapán; **super nice owner (she recommended Arroz2), Spanish treats that hit the spot on a hot day**
* **[Arroz2][arroz]**, Toledo, Spain -- paella negra; **local spot for good paella**
