Wow, last week in Austin over. I've had frustrations as is normal with all new challenging experiences, but it was overall a really really good experience (I say this with a big smile) because I've learned so much more than I could have imagined. About what I like and don't like, what I want and don't want in my life, professionally and personally. I'm also so much more comfortable and happy with who I am. Best summer I've had yet. 

I lived in Austin for 3 months this summer. And based on my experiences, here are some recs:
* You can't miss Lady Bird Lake; it's the Colorado River that runs through Austin where people kayak and stand-up paddleboard. You can also run, walk, bike, and scooter along it. Depending on where you are, you can get great views of downtown Austin's skyline. It's hard to enjoy this in late summer though when it's really hot and sunny.
* I love supporting local and buying fresh local organic seasonal product, so I visited the [downtown farmers' market][sfc] every weekend. It's small compared to ones from my hometown in the East Bay Area, but it had everything I needed. This particular farmers' market has free samples of many vendors' products; a fantastic french bakery stall; local jewelers; and food stalls (which I didn't try but looked good!), so visit if you can.
* Barton Springs Pool is a popular place. There's swimming in water sourced from nearby natural springs; it's cool water year round, no matter how hot it gets. In the heat of summertime, this is perfect activity. You have to pay to get in, but if you walk downhill from the paid/gated area, there's a free area where lots of people and dogs play.
* Capitol building is free for all and cool to see. It's where all state legistlative proceedings take place, so you see where these governmental processes occur. 
* [Cheer Up Charlies][cheerup], go there for drinks + with good company. They've got good cocktails and good vibes. Fantastic drag shows. 
* If you like hipster vibes, check out East Austin for food, coffee shops, and bars. 
* This [instagram (When Where What Austin)][www] came in clutch a few times. Thanks to them, my friends and I attended some cool art shows + free/discounted drinks + food events, good times.
* [Violet Crown][violetcrown] provides a very comfortable, clean, boutique theatre experience. Also, on 2nd street which looks pretty at night when all the lights wrapped around the trees are lit up. They show films, not blockbuster movies. Affordable.
* [Spiderhouse][spiderhouse] has several food trucks and outdoor area to eat and chat with company. It's got quirky decor that is like super Austin.
* [BookPeople][books] is a local bookstore with LOTS of books. Booklovers and appreciaters, come here.
* If you've got any interest in gokarting, go to [Circuit of the Americas][cota]. 
* [The Container Bar][container]. I didn't go here. They had a really long line that my friends + I didn't really care to wait for. But looks like fun place. If you want nightlife, checkout Red River and Rainey area; they've gotchu.

I cooked a lot this summer because it's affordable and I can cook nutritious dishes to my own liking. I also eat a plant-based diet, so very little to no meat. So, of the limited number of places and dishes I've tried, here are food places I would go back to eat again (and for some, actually did go back again):
* [Chi'lantro][chi] -- I went to their food truck near my office. It's Chipotle-style build your own, but with a Korean flair. Yummy, filling meal on cheaper end.
* [Xian Sushi and Noodle][xian] -- They specialize in hand-pulled noodles. Delicious, satisfied Asian food cravings, and also on cheaper end. 
* [Arpeggio Grill][arpeggio] -- They make very aromatic rice. Highly recommend the grilled fish plate; well seasoned and flavorful fish + aromatic rice. Meats were well seasoned; although, my parents said their meats were too salty for them. I got the vegetarian platter, which was decent but not fantastic. Affordable.
* [Wu Chow][wu] -- My frugal ass wouldn't go back here on my own. They've got very delicious Chinese flavors though, pretty authentic (coming from a Chinese person)! Love that they're farm-to-table, supporting local farms and serving fresh, local, organic, seasonal foods. High-end, classy feel. Pricey.
* [Veracruz All Natural][veracruz] -- I didn't eat here myself, never got a chance. However, if I had a choice, I would have come here for tacos because I appreciate their philosophy of using fresh, natural ingredients and like that they serve authentic Mexican food. I'm not familiar with authentic Mexican food flavors, but they seem legit to me. I could have been tricked though. However, 2 friends this summer tried their food, and they had raving reviews, so this place makes it on my list. 
* [Easy Tiger][easytiger] -- I also didn't eat here myself, but I've heard fantastic reviews about this place. My hobbyist breadmaker friends say their breads are freaking delicious. Good happy hour place.
