I've been protecting myself by not checking the news. I know there's a lot of not so good things happening due to the coronavirus, and I think the magnitude of it all is greater than I comprehend right now. However, for my own mental health, I've been doing my own thing at home. Newsletters from people I admire and respect, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and occasionally the local Chinese news have been my news source, which I check 1-2 times a day. 

I realized that I've surrounded myself with people who are serving others and amplifying the incredible people around the world who are serving others. With that, I'm still filled with hope and positivity from all the positive activities I'm virtually surrounded by:

* people are connecting with others. we're spending time with families, finding ways to connect with friends, learning to check in on people we know.
* communities are stepping up. in my neighborhood, people are offering to help older people purchase goods, share information about what's still available where, share resources and offer services for those who are in need.
* music is uplifting people in their homes. dnice's homeschool (aka club quarantine). singers' free concerts on Insta.
* celebration of food. chefs are cooking in their homes and sharing the experience and lessons with others. many chefs and organizations are offering free meals to the community. schools are offering free meals for children and families.
* love for farmers. so many people are finding ways to support their local farmers directly. farmers are still farming. they're literally the heart and blood of our food system, bless them.
* with so many people off roads, not traveling in planes, not outside (and littering), our air is cleaner. waters are cleaner. 
* downtime for many. we're conditioned to feel like we have to always be busy, doing something. and i think this is an important time to give ourselves a break, relax, take care of ourselves.
* people are caring for their personal health. exercising. cooking for themselves. reading. journaling. spending time with others. dancing. singing. and so much more.
* more and more attention, respect, and gratitude for all our service workers and how integral they are to our daily lives. the number of funds and donations to support those impacted by the pandemic is on the up and up.
* massive gratitude is spreading to heathcare providers and for all they do.
* appreciation teachers, these amazing people, are on the rise as parents spend 24/7 with their babies and some even attempt homeschooling. ain't that easy.
* energy is being directed to tending our land. more of my neighbors are starting to garden with their time. i am too!
* people (old and young) with sewing skills, small businesses, small distributors are working together to hand make masks to distribute to healthcare workers.
* drivers, airlines, transportation businesses are putting their resources to use to distribute masks, ventilators, food, and more.
* people are rallying for local restaurants, supporting them through donations to feed people in need.
* people are donating, cooking, distributing, and contributing in many forms to small and big community efforts to feed senior citizens, healthcare workers, and anyone in need of food.
* our broken healthcare, financial, and government system's flaws are becoming more apparent. and we are calling it out even more. grilling time.
* people are collectively staying at home to flatten the curve.
* hotels are lighting up vacant rooms in the shape of hearts, sending love to healthcare workers.
