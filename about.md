Hi, I’m Jenny!

This is my space to ruminate and share my adventures. 

When in conversation with others, I have a habit of asking lots of questions and wanting to know more about other people and what they’re doing, thinking, and wanting. I am also more quiet than talkative. I grew up in a household where conversing over dinner was not something we did. We didn't talk about emotions and feelings openly, especially personal struggles. I think that as a result, I’m not good at sharing information about myself and my own thoughts, and I don’t express myself as fully and accurately as I want.

This can be stifling sometimes. So, in an attempt to address this, I’m dedicating this blog to practice expressing myself through my thoughts and adventures. Welcome ☺

A <em>tidbit</em>* about me
</p>

There is much to learn about a person by discovering who people think they are, what other people think of them, and who people want to be. So, I’m going to introduce myself with 5 adjectives for each category. 

*<em>Of course, this doesn’t capture all of who I am. There are nuances, subtleties, and hidden characteristics in me like there are in everyone else.</em>

Adjectives that I think best describe me:
1.	Observant:: People tend to think I’m “quiet”, but I think I’m “observant”. In my moments of silence, I often pay attention to the things existing and happening around me.
2.	Conscientious:: Promoting and maintaining environmental and human health interests me. Learning about these topics have made me more thoughtful and intentional about the impact my daily actions have on the environment and people.
3.	Adventurous:: My mom instilled in me an excitement to try new things all the time because my parents worked around the clock most of my life. Knowing they couldn’t provide the new experiences to expose my brother and me to the world, they said ‘yes’ to every opportunity for my brother and I to get out of our bubble at home (e.g. school field trips, any event invite, after school programs).
4.	Action-oriented:: I can't stay still. If I feel stuck, stagnant, or confused, I will ask questions, move around, read, start a conversation, anything I think is useful to propel myself forward. 
5.	Open-minded:: College opened up many opportunities for me to travel to new places and interact with people I never expected to know. They’ve shown me a different way of living and thinking, which has enabled me to be more accepting and considerate of other ideas. You’ll never see me completely block off a new idea or suggestion unless it directly violates my values.

Adjectives that my friends use to describe me:
1.	Passionate:: My friends know that I care about the environment, health, and just overall trying to be a good person. They know that I know what I care about, and I strive to live by my values each and every day.
2.	Spontaneous:: I always love a surprise; it keeps life interesting. Unless my immediate response is a ‘no’ for a genuine reason (e.g. I’m extremely exhausted, significantly harms people, have other plans, I’m a little sketched out), I often say ‘yes’ to do something with someone at almost any time of day. 
3.	Diligent:: I work hard and try to learn the material taught in school. If I need help, I seek it out so I can get to where I want to be. When I need to get work done, I will do so instead of procrastinating (horribly).
4.	Consistent:: I stick to my values and live by them. I try to stand firm with my beliefs and act accordingly. I try to tell others why I do certain things and don't do others, and if you hear me talk enough, you'll notice the common threads in my life.
5.	Positive:: I have a habit of smiling a lot (I don’t even realize that I do it anymore). This is because I remember as a kid, people who smiled at me when responding always made me feel better than those who didn’t, so I learned to replicate. It makes people feel good. I also tend to not judge people very harshly, and I often look towards the bright side.

Adjectives that I want to embody more of…as of 7/31/19:
1. Confident:: I don’t think anyone ever uses this word to describe themselves (at least, I don’t know anyone). However, there have been many moments lately where I question myself, “You know you should have done that…Why didn’t you do it?” I want to experience less of those moments and just do more of what I know I should be doing.
2. Strong:: I want to feel good in my body and believe that I am physically strong. I can generally do one solid pull-up, so now I’m aiming to make that five. As a student, I live a pretty sedentary lifestyle; I’m planning to be more regularly active this summer.
3. Funny:: I think everything is better with a sprinkle of humor. I think I’m decent at making others smile, but I’d like to make people laugh more. 
4. Crazy:: I generally take things more seriously than not, so I am realistic about the ideas and things I think about and do. I want to think more outside the box, more creatively, and innovate more. And I want to act on these 'crazy' ideas.
5. Loving:: I hold high expectations for myself and sometimes this translates to others, especially my close friends and family. I want to judge less and love more.
