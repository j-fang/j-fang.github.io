Hi, I’m Jenny!

Welcome to my space of rumination and adventures. 

There is much to learn about a person by discovering who people think they are, what other people think of themselves, and who people want to be. So, I’m going to introduce myself with 5 adjectives for each category. (They're not listed in any particular order.) 

*<em>Of course, this doesn’t capture all of who I am. There are nuances, subtleties, and hidden characteristics in me like there are in everyone else.</em>

Adjectives that I think best describe me:
1. Action-oriented:: I can't stay still. If I feel stuck, stagnant, curious, excited, frustrated, or confused, I will ask questions, move around, read, talk to someone, anything I think is useful to propel myself forward. 
2. Conscientious:: Promoting and maintaining environmental and human health interests me. Learning about these topics have made me more thoughtful and intentional about the impact my daily actions have on the environment and people.
3. Observant:: People tend to think I’m “quiet”, but I think I’m “observant”. In my moments of silence, I often pay attention to the things happening around me.
4.	Adventurous:: My mom instilled in me an excitement to try new things all the time because my parents worked around the clock most of my life. Knowing they couldn’t provide the new experiences to expose my brother and me to the world, they said ‘yes’ to every opportunity for my brother and I to get out of our bubble at home (e.g. school field trips, any event invite, after school programs).	
5.	Positive:: I have a habit of smiling a lot (I don’t even realize that I do it anymore). This is because I remember as a kid, people who smiled at me when responding always made me feel better than those who didn’t, so I learned to replicate. It makes people feel good. I also tend to not judge people very harshly, and I often look towards the bright side.

Adjectives that my friends use to describe me:
1. Go-getter:: I do things, a lot (haha). When I complain about something, I find a way to address the problem. When I'm interested in something, I'll pursue it to satiate my curiosity.
2. Passionate:: My friends know that I care about the environment, health, and just overall trying to be a good person. They know that I know what I care about, and I strive to live by my values each and every day.
3.	Honest:: I tell things as they are to me, especially when my friends ask for my opinion. I don't sugarcoat things. I am conscientious of my friends' personalities and emotions though, so I do craft my responses accordingly. 
4.	Focused:: I don't like procrastinating, so I have a habit of frontloading work. I have the diligence to sit myself down and just get the work done, especially when I don't feel like doing it.
5.	Independent:: I've traveled to enough places and lived by myself that I've learned to take care of myself. I'm used to figuring how to make things work out on my own.

Adjectives that I want to embody more of:
1. Confident:: I don’t think anyone ever uses this word to describe themselves (at least, I don’t know anyone). However, there have been moments where I question myself, “You know you should have done that…Why didn’t you do it?” I want to experience less of those moments and just do more of what I know I should be doing.
2. Strong:: I want to feel physically strong. I can do one solid pull-up (maybe 2 on a good day), so now I’m aiming to make that five. I've been maintaining a consistent weekly exercise schedule so far! :) 
3. Funny:: Everything is better with a sprinkle of humor. I'd like to be able to make more people laugh around me every day. 
4. Crazy:: I generally take things more seriously than not, so I am realistic about the ideas and things I think about and do. I want to think more outside the box, more creatively, more strategically, and innovate more. And I want to act on these 'crazy' ideas.
5. Loving:: I hold high expectations for myself and sometimes this translates to others, especially my close friends and family. I want to judge less and love more.
