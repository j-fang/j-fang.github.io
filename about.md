Hi, I’m Jenny!

**Welcome to my space of rumination and adventures.**

There is much to learn about a person by knowing how they think of themselves, how others think of them, and how they want to be. So, I’m going to introduce myself in this way.

*<em>Of course, this doesn’t capture all of me. There's more to me than what you read.</em>

**I am:**
1. Action-oriented:: I can't stay still. If I feel stuck, stagnant, curious, excited, frustrated, or confused, I will ask questions, move around, read, talk to someone, anything I think is useful to propel myself forward. 
2. Conscientious:: Environmental and human health are fundamental for life. Caring about these have taught me how to be more thoughtful and intentional about the impact my daily actions have on the environment and people.
3. Observant:: I see and feel what's happening around me. I notice and remember things.
4.	Adventurous:: My mom instilled in me an excitement to try new things all the time because my parents worked around the clock most of my life. Knowing they couldn’t provide the experiences to expose my brother and me to the world, they said ‘yes’ to every opportunity for us to get out (e.g. school field trips, any event invite, after school programs), and I continue this.
5.	Positive:: I smile a lot. I remember as a kid, people who smiled when talking with me always made me feel good, so I learned to replicate. Also, I gravitate towards people who radiate positive energy, and I hope to do the same for others.

**My friends think I am:**
1. Go-getter:: I take action. When I complain, I find a way to address the problem. When I'm interested in something, I'll pursue it til I satiate my curiosity.
2. Passionate:: My friends know that I care about the environment, health, and just overall trying to be a good person. They know that I know what I care about, and I strive to live by my values everyday.
3.	Honest:: I tell things as they are to me, especially when my friends ask for my opinion. I don't sugarcoat things. I am conscientious of my friends' personalities and emotions though, so I do craft my responses accordingly. 
4.	Focused:: I don't like procrastinating, so I have a habit of frontloading work. I have the diligence to sit myself down and just get the work done, especially when I don't feel like doing it.
5.	Independent:: I've traveled to enough places and lived by myself that I can take care of myself. I'm used to figuring how to make things work out on my own.

**I want to be more:**
1. Funny:: Everything is better with humor. I'd like to be able to make more people laugh around me every day. 
2. Crazy:: I generally take things more seriously than not, so I am realistic about the ideas and things I think about and do. I want to think more outside the box, more creatively, more strategically, and innovate more. And I want to act on these 'crazy' ideas.
3. Loving:: I hold high expectations for myself and sometimes this translates to others, especially my close friends and family. I want to judge less and love more.
