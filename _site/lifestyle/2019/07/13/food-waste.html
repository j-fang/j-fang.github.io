    <p>When I see people not finish their food (at restaurants, parties, anywhere), I get a bit upset. I’m conflicted though because sometimes I wonder, what right do I have to tell people to finish their food when they’re full, don’t like the food, or just don’t want anymore of it.</p>

<p>What frustrates me about food waste is:</p>

<p>1) the resources invested in making that food is wasted. The water used to grow and wash the food. The time, energy, and effort that people put into growing, transporting, processing, and cooking the food.</p>

<p>2) there are hungry people in the world who would be so happy and grateful to eat your leftovers. Yet, they can’t. And these people who aren’t finishing their food often don’t seem to appreciate or understand how fortunate they are to have food in front of them. They don’t show any remorse over the waste of food.</p>

<p>3) most places and people do not dispose of their food waste properly. They often just toss it onto the trash, where the food will rot in landfills, releasing large amounts of methane that get trapped as more trash piles on top. This is problematic for our environment, because this trapping warms the atmosphere, thereby contributing to climate change in a not-so-beneficial way.</p>

<p>And btw, reducing food waste is #3 on <a href="https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/food/reduced-food-waste">Project Drawdown’s</a> list of climate solutions. Project Drawdown is a non-profit that curated a list of top 100 actions that people can take to effectively tackle climate change, based on <a href="https://www.drawdown.org/frequently-asked-questions">research</a> conducted around the world on climate change.</p>

<p>My mom raised me to eat every last grain of rice out of my bowl. No waste. When I was in India for a summer, I saw another level of “cleaning your plate”. People would use their chapati and/or hands to get every last grain of rice and drop of sauce. I’ve come to adopt a similar eating habit.</p>

<p>If I know I am going to an event where food is available, I will bring my own reusable food container in case there are any leftovers. So, no food waste and no to-go packaging waste. Oftentimes, I’ll eat everything on my plate though. (I know my apetite well and how much food I can take in.)</p>

<p>I love my friends. They will have me finish their leftovers or I will have them finish mine. But with people I’m not that close with, it is an odd request to make sometimes. Depending on how hungry, how bothered I am, how good the food is, how courageous I am in that moment, I will ask if I can finish their food. Sometimes, I leave it, say nothing, and leave bothered. I don’t want to be people’s “trashcan”.</p>

<p>I’m not saying people should do anything. I just wish people would be mindful of the impact of their actions and choices (in this case, with respect to food waste).</p>

        <p>I’ve put off writing this blog for years.  Because I&#39;ve been stressing over making myself sound like I know my stuff. But I&#39;m not perfect. I&#39;m trialing through life, just as everybody else is.  And I’m trying to embrace this by  finally just doing what I’ve been wanting to do:  practice processing my thoughts through written words, unfiltered.  </p>
