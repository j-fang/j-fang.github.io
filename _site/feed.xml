I got a vibe 
that this book club would touch upon female empowerment, which I’m a huge advocate for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had their meeting today, and the book of choice for this meeting is “The Source of Self-Regard” by Toni Morrison. I’ve heard her name mentioned a few times in my life, so I recognized it as a “big” name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started reading this book two days before the book club meeting, I did not expect something
so dense. I had to reread almost every paragraph a few times to really just understand what the words were. The meaning sunk in sometimes, and sometimes not. It didn’t help that I had things on my mind, which kept distracting me from Toni’s words. (Aside: did you know her Chloe? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notablebiographies.com/Mo-Ni/Morrison-Toni.html&quot;&gt;Chloe Anthony Wofford&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the small nuggets that did penetrate the depths of my brain, I could get a small glimpse of Toni’s brilliance, the truths she speaks of that is so relevant to the societal problems we see today. And I was conflicted. How can the work of such an incredibly smart woman be so inaccessible to everyday people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hear me out before you jump to conclusions about that question. Let me unpack that first. I didn’t get to finish the book as I tried to cram as much as I could before the book club meeting. FYI, cramming is a very poor method to read this book and to retain and understand meaning and messages that Toni conveys through her words. In the quick glimpses of the gems of Toni’s words, my mind was like, “Wow, that is so true. I wish more people could read this and understand it from Toni’s perspective.” Yet, I knew that I am not representative of the general young population. Most people my age would not spend the time to read this book nor choose it over another probably. A major part of it is because it’s not an easy read. How can this book be made more accessible to “everyday” people? It’s not fair for Toni to have to change her language, change her way of expression to appease “everyday” people, especially when even if it were an easy read, I don’t know if that many people would or could appreciate Toni’s words. But that’s one question that I had coming into the book club meeting: where is the balance in maintaining an author’s authenticity of their words and making that authenticity accessible to people? I didn’t have an answer and didn’t know how to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My takeaway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple attendees attempted to address my question. From their responses, I learned, realized, and have now come to believe that it’s not the author or artist’s responsbility to compromise their work to engage a larger population of people. It’s the reader’s responsibility to appreciate the artists’ work and efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an analogy that someone said which effectively captures this idea. An author and artist (authors are also artists) will work their butt off climbing up the mountain (producing their works of art. They welcome you up the mountain (by sharing their works through books, music, poetry, paintings, photography, and many more forms of art) to join them (to learn from another’s point of view). It is NOT the author’s responsibility to pull you up the mountain to get to the top (compromising or unnecessarily simplifying their work to satisfy others). It is your responsibility as a reader to do your part and get up there yourself. Of course, there is some balance of writing in a way that captures a reader’s attention, but that’s besides the point of this lesson I learned today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not meant to be easy for a reader. And I think that’s a lesson I didn’t learn well in school.
Middle and high school was all about getting the themes and summaries through CliffNotes, because 
“I had no idea” what the deeper meaning of this book is about. I never challenged myself to think
harder, to spend the time pondering an idea for longer timeframes, to revisit words and text and
see them with a refreshed perspective. I conditioned myself to be spoonfed it. I feel kind of 
ashamed about that now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea of working to meet an author where they’re at (in this mountain journey) extends to other artists too. Books, instrumental music, paintings, choreography, photographs, sculptures, singing, plays, operas. (These are just some examples.) I’ve been guilty of thinking, this book costs $30, what!? This ticket costs $500!? No way am I paying for this. Yet, people are willing to pay $900 for a new phone, thousands of dollars for a new computer. I’m guilty of it (the latter, not the former. I will not pay more than $400 for a phoneas of now. Who knows though, I may give in in a few years…:P)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are valid reasons why technology costs more and people are more willing to pay for them. But
the main idea I’m getting at here is that the values that our world at this point in time has
conditioned us to believe in is misaligned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t recognize the struggles, the emotions, the hardship that comes with writing and creating. It’s not easy!! (Let’s be real, I could never drop an album like Beyonce or even write a children’s song for a TV show like Sesame Street or Blue’s Clues). And this is partially due to the way media portrays people and how often they talk about success stories over people’s imperfect and difficult road to “success”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A challenge to myself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am now, thinking about what I can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m going to give “The Source of Self-Regard” another several attempts. It’s a book you gotta read and reread many more than several more times to extract all the nuggets of wisdom from.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If I ever encounter a difficult book to read, I will pause, recognize that, and not give up trying to read it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next time I engage with art through whatever medium (listening, seeing, touching, doing), I’m going to try to think about the artists and what they could have gone through to create that piece. Whether it’s good or bad art, it’s often not an easy thing to do. I’m going to intentionally spend a moment to recognize someone for their efforts to produce something new. And if I think it’s real good and worth keeping a copy of, I will support them as directly as I can (e.g. local bookstore &amp;gt; Amazon. I can also afford it right now. Compensation as a PM at a well-reputed tech company is higher than I ever expected to earn myself). We need more people trying to do something as opposed to nothing. I also believe that the world will benefit with more cultural and art appreciation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end or beginning of each new big event of my life (e.g. starting new school semester, ending a semester, starting an internship), I reflect. I think about what went well, what didn’t, what my goals are for the next phase of my year so I can live it better. And one thing I’ve been gradually changing is my diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m transitioning to eating a more plant-based diet, which focuses on: vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, and seeds. Do not interchange “plant-based” and “vegan”. There are so many vegan products out there now (e.g. Oreos, marshmallows, cookies), but they don’t fall into a plant-based diet. A plant-based diet means whole foods that come from nature and aren’t heavily processed and inadvertently, packaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up in a Chinese cultural environment, ½ of my parents’ cooking were always fish and meats. Having a huge interest in environmental sustainability and health, I knew, generally speaking, that it’s better to not eat so many meats and fish, but I didn’t know exactly why. I couldn’t tell you what exactly are the benefits, except that it’s “good”. So, with an intention to eat more plant-based and this lack of knowledge, I dove into learning more about nutrition for two weeks in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What stood out most to me in my research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The act of eating meat isn’t bad. Hundreds of years ago, people around the world ate animals, but they didn’t experience the high levels of chronic disease that people do today. The problem today is the way that the livestock industry has grown. The demand for meat has increased so dramatically, that farm businesses are taking shortcuts in order to increase their profit margins. As a consequence, animals are not treated humanely, which impacts the animals’ health and well-being. When we consume these animals, the biology of their health transfers into our bodies, which isn’t good for our health.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a lot to say about cooking and my experience, especially learning how to cook vegetables. But I’ll save that for another post that I will link here in the future. The main idea is that following a plant-based diet isn’t the hard part. I know what I should more of and should eat less of. The hard part is really learning how to change how my mind and taste buds react to vegetables and how to cook vegetables and make them tasty. Without a determination to commit to a plant-based diet, it’s easy to default back to sugary snacks and eat what I’m used to eating.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Here’s my summary of the importance of eating those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drfuhrman.com/get-started/eat-to-live-blog/62/the-healthiest-anti-cancer-foods-g-bombs&quot;&gt;GBOMBS&lt;/a&gt;:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;GBOMBS contain fiber that makes meals feel more satiating, so I won’t feel like I have to snack so much. Fiber also enables good bacteria in our intestines to grow, which boosts the biodiversity of our gut and enables our body to better protect against any attacks or imbalances.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products (e.g. milk, yogurt, cheese) don’t have any fiber in them.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;GBOMBS have high anti-inflammatory effects, which makes our bodies feel better. Inflammation in the body means an increased blood flow to areas of injury, infection, or perceived invasion of foreign substances. This results in bloating, aches, and pains.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;B12 is a vitamin that’s vital for DNA synthesis, maintaining our nervous systems, and red blood cell production. People tend to think that you can only get vitamin B12 from eating meat. This is because vitamin B12 is often found in animal muscles. &lt;a href=&quot;https://foodrevolution.org/blog/supplements-vegetarians-vegans-plant-based/?utm_campaign=frn19&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=email-automated&amp;amp;utm_content=5444&amp;amp;utm_term=existing-email-list&amp;amp;email=&amp;amp;firstname=Friend&amp;amp;lastname=&quot;&gt;However, microorganisms living in soil and water make B12, not animals.&lt;/a&gt; Animals, like cows, eat the grass or crops with B12 producing organisms that cling to the soil particles in the plant’s roots. However, because our water system is heavily treated and we transport food for such long distances, eating just plants won’t provide most people enough B12 for their bodies. A solution is eating B12 supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doing this research made me feel empowered and more confident. Because I can now explain why eating plants is better for our bodies and I have this knowledge backing my actions. There’s so much more I learned and took notes on (cause I can’t remember all that), but they get into more details that don’t feel as important to discuss right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;**Please note: the above summary is not well credited or sourced. I will do so when and if I feel like doing so. I may have misrepresented some information and could be incorrect; that is my own fault and I take credit for it. However, I don’t want these flaws to prevent me from pursuing the purpose of my writing: to practice expressing my thoughts, so I shall continue on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear: I am not perfect. I still eat meat (except beef, which I’ve completely cut out of my diet for the past year and a half). I do snack on packaged and processed sweets here and there and other foods that are not considered plant-based or “healthy”. And I’m fine with that. I don’t view life to be a strict “I have to do this” and “I can’t do that”. I think all that matters is that I am continuously improving and making progress towards my personal goal, and I am doing that. I’m actually really proud of how far I’ve come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I stand by the claim of my title&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haha, it’s funny, I still haven’t gotten to the story I wanted to share that inspired the title of this article. About a month ago, I stayed with my brother for a few days before his graduation. At that time, I had already made my summer goal of eating a more plant-based diet and learning how to cook tastier vegetable dishes. Those few days with my brother captured the opposite of my intentions for the summer. We ate out almost every meal those days, eating a wide variety of Asian cuisines (my favorite).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What shocked me was how little vegetables there were offered on the menus. We ate at a local Indian restaurant that was vegetarian only, which had the most vegetable dishes to offer. However, the ramen and sushi places we went to basically offered: noodles/rice and meat (i.e. pork, chicken, fish). I got a vegetarian ramen, which thank you California, had a decent serving of vegetables. But, my brother got a non-vegetarian dish that had only seaweed strips as “vegetables” on top. Just because someone orders a meat-based dish doesn’t mean we should be stripping it of vegetables! The sushi places we went to made me even sadder. Their vegetable offerings were American salads made of iceberg lettuce (one of the most useless and nutritionless vegetables to exist).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made me realize how little attention and value people place on vegetables, culturally here in the US. I don’t have enough experience to make such a statement for other countries, many for which I think this statement still holds true. This is when I realized that most people don’t eat enough vegetables. We don’t place enough value on them. We don’t understand the importance and value they provide to our health. We don’t understand or appreciate the efforts required to grow nutrient-dense produce for people. And many don’t understand the long term effects of including more fresh, local, organic, seasonal, non-GMO veggies in their diets. There’s also a dilemma of making this type of food accessible for everyone; education and access are huge factors in this equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation isn’t hopeless though. There are many people like &lt;a href=&quot;http://ronfinley.com/&quot;&gt;Ron Finley&lt;/a&gt; and organizations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consciouskitchen.org/&quot;&gt;The Conscious Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://urbanrootsatx.org/&quot;&gt;Urban Roots&lt;/a&gt;, who are doing something. I am doing something too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read to this point, thank you, I appreciate your interest and time to listen to me. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s a quote that I’ve found to be very empowering and true to how I try live my day to day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am only one, but I am one. I cannot do everything, but I can do something. And because I can’t do everything, I will not refuse to do the something I can do.” -Edward Everett Hale&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Me + Plant-based diet</summary></entry></feed>
