I’ve had frustrations as is normal with all new challenging experiences, but it was overall a really really good experience (I say this with a big smile) because I’ve learned so much more than I could have imagined. About what I like and don’t like, what I want and don’t want in my life, professionally and personally. I’m also so much more comfortable and happy with who I am. Best summer I’ve had yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lived in Austin for 3 months this summer. And based on my experiences, here are some recs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can’t miss Lady Bird Lake; it’s the Colorado River that runs through Austin where people kayak and stand-up paddleboard. You can also run, walk, bike, and scooter along it. Depending on where you are, you can get great views of downtown Austin’s skyline. It’s hard to enjoy this in late summer though when it’s really hot and sunny.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I love supporting local and buying fresh local organic seasonal product, so I visited the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainablefoodcenter.org/programs/sfc-farmers-market&quot;&gt;downtown farmers’ market&lt;/a&gt; every weekend. It’s small compared to ones from my hometown in the East Bay Area, but it had everything I needed. This particular farmers’ market has free samples of many vendors’ products; a fantastic french bakery stall; local jewelers; and food stalls (which I didn’t try but looked good!), so visit if you can.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Barton Springs Pool is a popular place. There’s swimming in water sourced from nearby natural springs; it’s cool water year round, no matter how hot it gets. In the heat of summertime, this is perfect activity. You have to pay to get in, but if you walk downhill from the paid/gated area, there’s a free area where lots of people and dogs play.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capitol building is free for all and cool to see. It’s where all state legistlative proceedings take place, so you see where these governmental processes occur.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cheerupcharlies.com/&quot;&gt;Cheer Up Charlies&lt;/a&gt;, go there for drinks + with good company. They’ve got good cocktails and good vibes. Fantastic drag shows.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you like hipster vibes, check out East Austin for food, coffee shops, and bars.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/whenwherewhataustin/&quot;&gt;instagram (When Where What Austin)&lt;/a&gt; came in clutch a few times. Thanks to them, my friends and I attended some cool art shows + free/discounted drinks + food events, good times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://austin.violetcrown.com/&quot;&gt;Violet Crown&lt;/a&gt; provides a very comfortable, clean, boutique theatre experience. Also, on 2nd street which looks pretty at night when all the lights wrapped around the trees are lit up. They show films, not blockbuster movies. Affordable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spiderhouseatx.com/&quot;&gt;Spiderhouse&lt;/a&gt; has several food trucks and outdoor area to eat and chat with company. It’s got quirky decor that is like super Austin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bookpeople.com/&quot;&gt;BookPeople&lt;/a&gt; is a local bookstore with LOTS of books. Booklovers and appreciaters, come here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’ve got any interest in gokarting, go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.circuitoftheamericas.com/&quot;&gt;Circuit of the Americas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://austincontainerbar.com/&quot;&gt;The Container Bar&lt;/a&gt;. I didn’t go here. They had a really long line that my friends + I didn’t really care to wait for. But looks like fun place. If you want nightlife, checkout Red River and Rainey area; they’ve gotchu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cooked a lot this summer because it’s affordable and I can cook nutritious dishes to my own liking. I also eat a plant-based diet, so very little to no meat. So, of the limited number of places and dishes I’ve tried, here are food places I would go back to eat again (and for some, actually did go back again):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chilantrobbq.com/&quot;&gt;Chi’lantro&lt;/a&gt; – I went to their food truck near my office. It’s Chipotle-style build your own, but with a Korean flair. Yummy, filling meal on cheaper end.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xianfresh.com&quot;&gt;Xian Sushi and Noodle&lt;/a&gt; – They specialize in hand-pulled noodles. Delicious, satisfied Asian food cravings, and also on cheaper end.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arpeggiogrill.com/&quot;&gt;Arpeggio Grill&lt;/a&gt; – They make very aromatic rice. Highly recommend the grilled fish plate; well seasoned and flavorful fish + aromatic rice. Meats were well seasoned; although, my parents said their meats were too salty for them. I got the vegetarian platter, which was decent but not fantastic. Affordable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wuchowaustin.com/&quot;&gt;Wu Chow&lt;/a&gt; – My frugal ass wouldn’t go back here on my own. They’ve got very delicious Chinese flavors though, pretty authentic (coming from a Chinese person)! Love that they’re farm-to-table, supporting local farms and serving fresh, local, organic, seasonal foods. High-end, classy feel. Pricey.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.veracruzallnatural.com/&quot;&gt;Veracruz All Natural&lt;/a&gt; – I didn’t eat here myself, never got a chance. However, if I had a choice, I would have come here for tacos because I appreciate their philosophy of using fresh, natural ingredients and like that they serve authentic Mexican food. I’m not familiar with authentic Mexican food flavors, but they seem pretty legit to me. I could have been tricked though. However, I’ve had 2 friends this summer try their food, and they had raving reviews, so this place makes it on my list.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.easytigerusa.com/&quot;&gt;Easy Tiger&lt;/a&gt; – I also didn’t eat here myself, but I’ve heard fantastic reviews about this place. Their breads I here from hobbyist breadmaker friends are freaking delicious. Good happy hour place.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason for trip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cooked a bulk pot of pink rice that I got from Wheatsville a week ago when it was on sale (#trynewfoodwhenitsonsale). I overestimated and made like 10 meals’ worth of rice, when I was aiming for 4-5. I store the rice in fridge, which is fine except the rice dries out. So, to compensate for the dryness, I know I need to cook saucy veggies. So my goal of this trip was to get a jar of sauce under $5, probably a curry-like sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons for why I’m super happy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I slept in til 10:30am. Although I did sleep at 2am-ish, I felt like I finally got the sleep I needed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A cointern introduced me to the field of healthcare technology and I’ve been starting to read and learn about the industry through the lens of disruptive innovation. I’m in the state where I just found a new interest and am super excited about understanding it. There’s so many tabs on my computer right now, and I just requested about 10 books from my college to read (upon my return in 2 weeks!).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I like my outfit today, and I feel good in it. It’s just a simple colorful dress, my Birkenstocks, + my trusty grocery tote bag.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s sunny outside, so that raised my vitamin D levels, as I made my bus adventure over to Wheatsville.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wheatsville has a compost bin. I collect my compost until I make a trip to a grocery store with composting or my compost containers are all full, so I finally got to empty my containers after 2 weeks! People have noted that my collection of compost and disposal process seems very extra; call it what you will. I am proud to divert ~95% of my waste from the landfill. Composting ensures my food scraps get recycled into nutrients for soil. Landfilling waste ensures more methane is released into the atmosphere, thereby worsening climate change. (Landfills are so compact with trash that anaerobic decomposition occurs, which produces methane as a byproduct. Methane, btw, is 34x worse than CO2 in warming effect.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wheatsville has free food samples. I love food, and I love good free food.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wheatsville also had organic peaches on sale: $1.99/lb. A month or two ago, it was $2.49/lb at Whole Foods (and that was considered on sale). These peaches were pretty soft and ripe, so I’m guessing it’s due to an abundant supply. Regardless, #yayseasonalfruits and yay for on sale organic produce. I had a realization yesterday. I’ve been craving sweets for the past two weeks, and have turned towards eating a lots of granola bars at work, which has a bunch of added sugar. Yesterday, I went to the farmers’ market and got a locally grown organic korean melon for $2! (Has like 6-ish servings worth?) A korean melon, as described to me and I can now confirm having ate it, is a fruit like a watermelon but with a firmer texture like an apple. (The skin can also be eaten, it tastes fine to me!) Anyways, I realized I haven’t eaten real fruit in like 2 weeks. In the beginning of my summer, I would eat a bunch of fruits (e.g. blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, peaches, nectarines, pluots) to satisfy my sweet tooth and ate nothing with added sugars for a whole month. Then that streak broke down. Me not buying fruits was partially 1) Austin farmers’ markets don’t have many fruit offerings, and 0 that are organic 2) I didn’t want to buy fruits from Whole Foods cause I don’t want to support Amazon and 3) not needing to go to grocery stores to buy anything else. After eating my korean melon, I realized that I need more real fresh fruit in my diet (&lt;a href=&quot;https://foodrevolution.org/blog/sugar-substitutes/&quot;&gt;real fruit &amp;gt; sugary sweets&lt;/a&gt;). So I was real happy to bought a bunch of peaches on sale.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grocery shopping is my favorite type of shopping, so just being in a grocery store lifted my mood.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I found a coconut curry sauce within my budget. Plus, it’s in a reusable glass jar!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wheatsville is a special place; it embodies and practices environmental and social stewardship in ways I wish more grocery stores would do. Wherever I live, I want to have a Wheatville-like grocery store near me. If there isn’t one, I want to start one.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;They offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eoproducts.com/&quot;&gt;EO hand sanitizer&lt;/a&gt; instead of convetional brands like Purcell.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;They offer compostable bags over plastic.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;They support and stock a lot of local brands and label them. Supporting local is important in boosting the local economy. Buying local means more money you spend remains in your community because local businesses tend to support local vendors as well, contributing towards increasing more local jobs and supporting local distribution and processing systems.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;They use non-plastic (paper) sample cups.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;They have a bulk section which is where I get all my grains and legumes. I love that they have bulk peanut butter.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;They have weekly sales that make shopping local and organic more affordable. They also have what basic staples priced at affordable price points.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their bakery makes their pastries and breads look so freaking delicious and wholesome.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their housemade desserts, pastries, and breads are made with unenriched and unbleached flours (read about what’s problematic with enriched and bleached flour &lt;a href=&quot;https://foodbabe.com/ingredients-to-avoid/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). They’re also not filled with a ton of additives, preservatives, and added sugars, as I see in Whole Foods’ baked goods.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;They support local non-profits by offering customers to round up their total to nearest dollar to donate to a different non-profit each month.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;They ask me if I want my receipt. I always refuse, and they don’t print it out. Unlike Whole Foods, where even if I say no, it’s printed out and thrown into the trash; what a freaking waste. I don’t take receipts because 1) I don’t need it. If I do, I just take photo of the computer screen. 2) 94% of receipts are lined with BPA and BPS, which are endocrine disruptors. (Read more about impact of receipts &lt;a href=&quot;https://greenamerica.org/report-STS&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) I don’t know if Wheatsville’s receipts are lined with BPA or not, cause I’ve never taken one.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It holds so many brands that I love and also has introduced me to brands I was previously unfamiliar with that are very mindful of their environmental and social impact. I discovered the brand &lt;a href=&quot;https://fitppl.com/&quot;&gt;fitppl&lt;/a&gt; today because they were offering samples. I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.truvani.com/&quot;&gt;Truvani’s plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt;, which I mix with water and drink a few times a week. I like Truvani because it’s founded by a food blogger I follow. She taught me a lot about how the food industry is tricking consumers in thinking their food is “healthy”. Her company is focused on transparency and clean ingredients, but there’s more a company can do. fitppl does this, I absolutely love their initiative more. Their site talks about building healthy soil and promoting biodiversity through sourcing their ingredients. They are thoughtful of their waste output and their product reflects their initiative to reduce their waste as much as possible. Their ingredients are certified organic and they source locally in Texas as much as possible (they’re an Austin-based company). They raise awareness about plastic pollution and actively participate in trash cleanups in the community. (Yesssss, you rock fitppl!)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;There are definitely more reasons why I love Wheatsville and local independent grocery stores, but these are the reasons that were on the top of my mind today.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I came back to make lunch, and very pleased with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayakaimal.com/product/prod-rs-coconutcurry/&quot;&gt;Goan curry by Maya Kaimal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am also very proud of how far I’ve come with cooking. My palate and cooking skills have changed. I make veggie stir fries that have satisfied my appetite and taste buds. (Btw, I learned how to steam beet, and am uber proud that I can cook beets now.) Next goal is to learn how to make my own sauces and I’ll be set to make any dish incredibly tasty (to me, at least).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it’s what Wheatsville stands for, my enjoyment and appreciation of their values and practices, and this realization during my experience in their store today that made me happy, and I just had to share. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="lifestyle" /><summary type="html">I just got back from a trip to Wheatsville Food Co-op, and I’m super happy right now.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Don’t ask me ‘How are you’.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ponderings/2019/07/31/how-are-you.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Don't ask me 'How are you'." /><published>2019-07-31T03:05:25-05:00</published><updated>2019-07-31T03:05:25-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ponderings/2019/07/31/how-are-you</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ponderings/2019/07/31/how-are-you.html">&lt;p&gt;Note: This is a rant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of answer do you expect to hear from this? Do you actually care how I am? People have literally asked me this while smiling and walking away… I’m thinking, why did you waste your breath? You make yourself think you’re being nice by asking, but you’re really not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, at work, people will ask me how I am. I saw you yesterday. You know just as well as I do that we both woke up in the last hour or two, went through our morning routine, and came to work. There’s not much to my day so far, and I’m just ‘good’ or ‘okay’. (hahaha, those are my usual go-to answers. They hold validity though. If I’m feeling ‘good’ I say so. If I’m not feeling above average, then I go with ‘okay’.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if I were actually doing bad, do you think asking me how I am will invite me to divulge the emotions and thoughts that consume my mind? Do you even want that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I’m looking really deep into this, but hey, it entertains me right now. All this is to say, I’m not about this common form of greeting. Just say hi, smile and let’s move on with our day. If you really care about me and want to know more, ask me a more specific question and ask follow up questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="ponderings" /><summary type="html">Note: This is a rant.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A weekend trip to Houston.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/adventures/2019/07/22/houston.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A weekend trip to Houston." /><published>2019-07-22T03:05:25-05:00</published><updated>2019-07-22T03:05:25-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/adventures/2019/07/22/houston</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/adventures/2019/07/22/houston.html">&lt;p&gt;A couple cointerns and I made a road trip to Houston this weekend. After work on Friday, we picked up our rental car and peaced out of Austin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this on drive back to Austin. Overall impression from our time here: a weekend is plenty of time to see Houston (we wouldn’t know what else to do if we had more time). Houston appears, from our visitor’s perspective, to be “big”, spread out, “quiet”, “suburban”, hot. (quotes are words my cointerns used) I think there are more gems to Houston that we didn’t see, but that’s alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This opinion is based on our following adventures to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mala Sichuan Bistro&lt;/strong&gt; – disappointment. It didn’t satisfy my cravings for authentic quality Chinese food. It was definitely made by chinese people though. I was so excited for mapo tofu, but their sauce seemed way too oily and seemingly watered down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snowy Village&lt;/strong&gt; – classic Chinese/Asian dessert spot with shaved ice. Hella popping.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airbnb&lt;/strong&gt; – that was interesting. We entered the place to discover all the sheets and towels were used and noticably dirty by previous occupants. The host didn’t respond to our message until next morning. So we improvised and washed some of the towels and sheets in their washing machines with the remaining shampoo they had. We had clean towels to shower with in the morning, so it all worked out and we were satisfied with the host refunding us our first night’s stay.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbanharvest.org/farmersmarkets/&quot;&gt;Urban East Side Farmers’ Market&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – I look forward to the farmers’ market every weekend, and I try to visit the local farmers’ market everywhere I go. There were lots of stands for produce, pastries, and food. I was most excited about some candied ginger and orange peels I got for my mom because she likes candied ginger. (packaged in reusable glass jar was bonus) I also got groceries for the week, lol. Some prices were cheaper than Austin and I needed groceries.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blacksmith&lt;/strong&gt; – cointerns wanted coffee. Place had good vibes. I’m not much of a coffee drinker so I didn’t care too much for the place. According to my cointern who cares about coffee a whole lot more, he said the place gave him TJ Maxx level coffee feels.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.menil.org/&quot;&gt;The Menil Collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – I’m not a huge art appreciater. However, both my cointerns are. So it was a nice surprise to have spent 2.5 hours here. We looked at each piece of art, and I can appreciate art a little bit more now. I wouldn’t voluntarily choose to go see it on my own, but if I’m there, I wouldn’t mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Menil Bookstore&lt;/strong&gt; – Ehh, I didn’t care for it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cy Twombly Gallery&lt;/strong&gt; – I found one piece I really liked there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://andescafe.com/&quot;&gt;Andes Cafe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – This was my favorite part of the trip; food is often holds a special part of my adventures. The staff was super welcoming and kind. I don’t eat South American food much (only a few times in my life), so this was a fantastic introduction to the cuisine (specifically, Venezuelan and Ecuadorean) and I’m intrigued to eat more now. Favorite dish was by far the cachapas; these Venezuelan sweet corn pancakes were flippin’ delicious. The cuisine is not very vegetarian friendly. I did try a little bit of meat to taste the flavors and got lots of seafood from the ceviche mixto. But I mostly ate and picked around the meat while my buddies ate the meat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rice University&lt;/strong&gt; – We walked around a little bit and hung out at the Skyspace (not necessary to see…its a ceiling with a square whole). It was very peaceful and lots of green trees and grass. The buildings are very simple, lots of brick in a non-intrusive kind of way. That’s as best I can describe it;I wasn’t impressed by the buildings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drove through &lt;strong&gt;Downtown&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Heights&lt;/strong&gt; area – downtown view from afar at night is cool to see. Being in downtown though, I felt so small being surrounded by such large buildings. The glass builidngs and lack of culture created a cold environment. We drove through for like 5  minutes and bounced. The Heights neighborhood was only a couple streets, but pleasant to drive through. We were there when most shops were about to close, so we didn’t bother walking around.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agorahouston.com/&quot;&gt;Agora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – interesting cafe-like place. They have wine, beer, a greek frappuccino, and sweet and nice looking pastries. Good vibes to chat, work, read, write, anything I’d want to do in a cafe.
Prior to Agora, we stopped by a few cute small shops mext to it. Nice to browse.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bar hopping&lt;/strong&gt; – We were in Montrose area. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anvilhouston.com/&quot;&gt;Anvil Bar + Refuge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has some good cocktails. Otherwise, no good dance music (which is what I look for, specifically hip hop, rap, pop). Not good scene for people in early 20s, for sure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thai Stellar&lt;/strong&gt; – Prior to visiting NASA Johnson Space Center, we got food. It’s standard Thai cuisine, very cheap (you can get meal under $10). When they ask you for spice level, note that level 4 (what most my table got) was not spicy at all, for people who like and don’t mind spicy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rocket Park at NASA Johnson Center&lt;/strong&gt; – Seeing the rockets made me have a greater respect for the human mind. Literally, I cannot comprehend the inputs required to enable humans to send a person to outer space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bucc-ee’s&lt;/strong&gt; – This is like a Walmart gas station that is a unique experience in Texas. It just has lots of gas stations, car wash stations, huge store. So many people recommended seeing it, and we did. I was frustrated seeing all the plastic and single-use plastics available here. Because of my interests in sustainability, health, and nutrition, I was not impressed by the place. However, I do think it’s worth to stop by if it’s on your way to a destination though; interesting take on gas station.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it was a good trip overall. Even though it was only a 48 hour trip, it felt like a really long time, like a whole week. Work seems so far away. I think the feeling that it was a long trip means I really lived in the present and was enjoying the moments. I’m still thinking about the cachapas and the sauce from the camarones (shrimp) we ordered; freaking delicious. I want more. :P&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="adventures" /><summary type="html">A couple cointerns and I made a road trip to Houston this weekend.

I got a much-needed good night’s sleep, no alarm to wake me up. Put in a little workout in the morning and off to the farmers’ market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austin is cool in that it has municipal composting. My apartment doesn’t have composting, but I can make a trip to my preferred grocery stores and compost my food scraps there. I collect my week’s compost in my freezer, and it was piling up, so I made a trip to Whole Foods to dispose of my compost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, my bro called me, which was a really nice surprise! We talked for an hour, where he filled me in on his first week at his new job (exciting)! We had a good sibling chat, while I enjoyed the views of families and individuals enjoying the park next to the downtown farmers’ market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bus day today, aka I got a 24 hour bus pass to travel around Austin. This was mainly due to the very hot weather and my need to get to places faster than it would take me to walk to places. I’m not sure what was going on though, but so many people smiled at me today. I think it might be because I have a natural tendency to smile at people who I make eye contact with. And people’s natural instinct is to smile back. However, I noticed it a lot more today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made me feel extra good to be smiled at. If you’re curious as to why I have a natural tendency to smile a lot and to people, it’s because it feels good to be smiled at, and it makes others smile. When I was little, I liked people who smiled at me. And wanting others to like me, I practiced smiling at other people, genuinely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I learned here in Austin is that it’s nice to say ‘thank you’ to the bus drivers. It seems obvious but so few people do it. When I took my first bus trip in Austin, I saw a guy say ‘thank you’ to the bus driver when he got off. And in my head, I was like, “Wow, that’s so nice!” So I’ve been doing that too now. When I get off, I’ll look at the bus driver via their mirror, say thank you (and smile if I remember to, I’m not super conscious when I smile anymore), maybe wave, and get off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also say ‘hi’ to the bus driver and smile every time I get on. Today, every single bus driver smiled back and said ‘hi’ to me. It made me feel good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found an African fashion show to attend, and there, I made eye contact with this little girl. I smiled, and her face lit up, and she smiled back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hahaha, these aren’t really exciting stories, but as I am writing about them, it just makes me smile and feel good. There’s lots of positive energy that comes from this small exchange. I had more smile exchanges with vendors at the farmers’ market today, other attendees of the African fashion show, and people in my apartment building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend, I’m dedicating to being alone and getting a lot more content editing done for my app. I had a little too much excitement this week and need a break from fully engaging with people. And I have to say, this weekend is the best weekend I’ve had so far. It feels good to be alone, to do my own thing and have small moments of positivity with so many strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was more a brain dump and my day’s update, haha. The main takeaway though: smiling is magic, try it. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="lifestyle" /><summary type="html">Today was a good Saturday.

I’m conflicted though because sometimes I wonder, what right do I have to tell people to finish their food when they’re full, don’t like the food, or just don’t want anymore of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What frustrates me about food waste is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) the resources invested in making that food is wasted. The water used to grow and wash the food. The time, energy, and effort that people put into growing, transporting, processing, and cooking the food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) there are hungry people in the world who would be so happy and grateful to eat your leftovers. Yet, they can’t. And these people who aren’t finishing their food often don’t seem to appreciate or understand how fortunate they are to have food in front of them. They don’t show any remorse over the waste of food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) most places and people do not dispose of their food waste properly. They often just toss it onto the trash, where the food will rot in landfills, releasing large amounts of methane that get trapped as more trash piles on top. This is problematic for our environment, because this trapping warms the atmosphere, thereby contributing to climate change in a not-so-beneficial way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And btw, reducing food waste is #3 on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/food/reduced-food-waste&quot;&gt;Project Drawdown’s&lt;/a&gt; list of climate solutions. Project Drawdown is a non-profit that curated a list of top 100 actions that people can take to effectively tackle climate change, based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drawdown.org/frequently-asked-questions&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; conducted around the world on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom raised me to eat every last grain of rice out of my bowl. No waste. When I was in India for a summer, I saw another level of “cleaning your plate”. People would use their chapati and/or hands to get every last grain of rice and drop of sauce. I’ve come to adopt a similar eating habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I know I am going to an event where food is available, I will bring my own reusable food container in case there are any leftovers. So, no food waste and no to-go packaging waste. Oftentimes, I’ll eat everything on my plate though. (I know my apetite well and how much food I can take in.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love my friends. They will have me finish their leftovers or I will have them finish mine. But with people I’m not that close with, it is an odd request to make sometimes. Depending on how hungry, how bothered I am, how good the food is, how courageous I am in that moment, I will ask if I can finish their food. Sometimes, I leave it, say nothing, and leave bothered. I don’t want to be people’s “trashcan”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying people should do anything. I just wish people would be mindful of the impact of their actions and choices (in this case, with respect to food waste).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="lifestyle" /><summary type="html">When I see people not finish their food (at restaurants, parties, anywhere), I get a bit upset.

&lt;p&gt;I’m a little heated about this topic. Call me extra or strict, but my feelings are valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, company provided fried chicken + mac and cheese + fries + mixed greens salad from Happy Chicks for lunch. The main vegetarian/vegan option was vegan fried chicken and vegetarian mac and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t speak for everyone; these are my opinions. As someone who voluntarily chooses to eat a plant-based diet (I define as no animal meat; little to no dairy products; lots of whole vegetables and fruits from farms; and lots ancient grains, legumes, and beans.), I have no interest in eating fake meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not alone in this; I have talked to other people who choose to follow a vegan and vegetarian diet. We once talked about the Impossible burger. An acquaintance was vegetarian for like 6 years; she thought she would try the Impossible burger since it was such a huge deal. After a bite, she literally spit it all out because it tasted and felt too similar to meat for her (whether that is accurate is relative. She hadn’t had anything meat-like textured for so long that anything remotely close to meat texture would seem meat-like.) We choose to not eat animal products, so what’s the point of trying to imitate it and pursuing it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://foodrevolution.org/blog/plant-based-meat-alternatives/&quot;&gt;fake meat is often made with refined oils (processed the hell out of), GMO soy (large traces of pesticides, herbicides, and insecticides, especially glyphosate, an active ingredient in RoundUp, a common weed killer), and additives that have little nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. No thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fake meat, in my opinion, is mainly geared towards serving the meat eaters in the world, to help them reduce their meat consumption for the sake of mitigating climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I was hella disappointed in the lunch offered today. What about the vegetarian mac and cheese and fries? A company called “Happy Chicks” is ironic considering how many “chicks” they kill to do business, and I highly doubt those “chicks” were well taken care of when they were alive. From a moral and ethical standpoint, no thanks. I have no interest in eating anything you have to serve. I’m objectively speaking a healthy conscious eater, so I doubt their fries and mac and cheese were of anything worthwhile to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just brought my own lunch to eat today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A snippet of my journey to shifting my mindset to eating less meat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see why the food is so enticing. The entire food area smelled of fried foods, and it did smell good. The food is all deep fried such that there’s lots of crunch; I can see, smell, and understand the appeal. However, this is all about mindset and the environment in which we grew up in and how it has impacted our view of what is considered “good” food. And I’m at a point where I eat for nutrition and nourishment. I (most of the time) know what I am putting in my body and make sure it is good for me and my environment. I’m not perfect; sometimes, I pursue ignorance (oftentimes for sweets, I’m a sucker for a tasty cheesecake).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been following a plant-based diet for about 3 months now. I care for the environment; however, diet change was something I was reluctant to do; it was a bit hard to transition. I grew up eating lots of chicken, fish, and pork; it’s part of many Chinese dishes. However, as I was reading more about the impact of &lt;a href=&quot;https://foodprint.org/issues/raising-animals-industrial-system/&quot;&gt;raising animals in an industrial system&lt;/a&gt; and knowing that I want to live by the values I talk about, I chose to reduce my meat consumption slightly. I chose chicken over pork and beef. I also opted for smaller meat portions in a meal. Inside though, I knew I could be doing so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My commitment journey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I saw this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUnJQWO4YJY&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, and it was the tipping point for me to 100% commit to cutting out meat from my diet. The logic is there, and I knew it was my mentality that was holding me back from not eating any meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with cutting beef out of my diet. It was an easy start because beef isn’t a significant component of my diet. Now, it’s been 2 years my diet is almost beef-free. I did accidentally eat it a couple times, mistaking a dish had pork when it actually had beef, but it’s all good. I know mistakes happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m in the process of weaning off pork and chicken. It’s hard at home because my parents cook it so often, but now that I’m on my own this summer and I am in control of my purchasing choices, it is very much easier. I haven’t completely cut it out of my diet. I’ve cut about 95% of it out of my diet though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, when I go out to eat, I will choose a plant-based dish. So, when I’m out, my diet is 100% meat free because I know most places I eat at will not source pasture-raised certified humane meats. However, I have bought a pasture-raised certified humane organic chicken from the farmers’ market to make a soup for the “healing” properties after my period; it’s something my mom makes for me. I am okay with this right now because I at least know I am supporting local and ethical practices in raising animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another big adjustment to cutting meat out from my diet is learning how to cook and eat more vegetables to make up for the lack of meat in most of my meals. I used be hungry very often because I wasn’t proportionately swapping the vegetables for meat. Practice, commitment, and patience have been critical in helping me get to where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’ve noticed changes in my body. I can’t 100% attribute these changes to just my diet change because I’ve changed a lot both in mindset and lifestyle in the past couple years. But I know for sure (gotta take my word for it and the numerous research studies out there) that eating less meat has contributed to empowering my body with more natural good energy. I feel good in my body, I love what I eat and what I do, and I’m just enjoying life right now. And I know I’m not contributing as much to the factors that contribute to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to convert you to not eat meat. I’m a supporter of &lt;a href=&quot;https://foodprint.org/eating-sustainably/eating-meat-sustainably/&quot;&gt;eating less meat and better meat&lt;/a&gt;. My main goal with this post is to release the frustration I have about people’s assumption that “Oh, we have vegan meats available so you can eat too!” and share a little bit of my journey of including less meat in my diet. It wasn’t super easy, but I’m determined and I’ve made a significant amount of progress; I’m proud to be where I’m at.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="lifestyle" /><summary type="html">Preachin’</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My life in Austin.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/lifestyle/2019/07/07/Austin-life.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My life in Austin." /><published>2019-07-07T04:05:25-05:00</published><updated>2019-07-07T04:05:25-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/lifestyle/2019/07/07/Austin-life</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/lifestyle/2019/07/07/Austin-life.html">&lt;p&gt;As of 7/7/2019, I am 5 weeks into my summer here in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How have I been spending my time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work M-F around 9am-6pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My morning routine involves meditating with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wakingup.com/&quot;&gt;Waking Up App&lt;/a&gt; by Sam Harris, bathroom stuff, and then I’ll make breakfast and prep lunch. And off I walk to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my walk back to apartment after work, I’ll often call my mom, brother (main one recently), or a friend to chat with. My apartment has a swimming pool that I swim in about 3x a week after work (best workout – can’t feel my sweat, get exercise, not sunny cause the height of the apartment blocks the sun). I’ll cook dinner, usually some kind of stir fry of veggies mixed with black beans, lentils, oatmeal, buckwheat groats, or brown rice. Finish meal with a piece of fruit (loving the summer stone fruits right now). Work on app project and maybe call up a friend or my brother. Music has always been on for at least some part of my day, especially when in my apartment (cause it gets quiet and still sometimes), so I get some dancing (and maybe a little bit of singing) in on the daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My weekend routine includes shopping at farmers’ market for groceries; doing something new or exploring a new part of Austin; reflecting and journaling; meeting with my app project team; working on app project; and hanging out with at least one coworker. This has been a consistent routine each weekend so far. Usually Saturday is my adventure and explore day, and Sunday is my stay-at-apartment-to-work-day. Either way, I make sure I get out of the apartment for at least an hour each day. I usually make a trip to a grocery store (used to be Whole Foods, but now switching to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wheatsville.coop/&quot;&gt;Wheatsville Co-op&lt;/a&gt;) if I’ve been in my apartment all day. An aside: I love grocery shopping, because I love food and I love seeing more organic, fair trade, local options available in stores. I don’t like any other shopping (e.g. clothes, malls, cars, house). To me, they’re a waste of time; I’d rather do other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s a list of what I think are interesting things I’ve done so far (not in any particular order):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nightlife in Red River Cultural District (Cheer Up Charlie’s drag show + Stubb’s LANY concert) and Rainey St. –&amp;gt; Accidentally got a little drunk for first time(!) I was fine, just little off balanced, but I had supportive co-interns dancing and keeping an eye out for me. ;) It was a fun night.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tried out a few fitness classes: Ro Fitness (good cardio), Lagree Studio (kicked my butt, that was tough but good workout), City Surf Fitness (ehhh, wasn’t fan of instructor and not great workout)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SFC Downtown Farmers’ Market!! I look forward to this every Saturday; it’s where I get 95% of my groceries and actually found a local jeweler who made very beautiful simple everyday rings (I got 3).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whole Foods Market cafe. In need of getting out of my apartment, I ventured here to work on the weekends (for app project). Interesting moment here was getting into a conversation with a stranger for like 2 hours after he asked to borrow my Android phone charger. We talked about a lot of things: career, family, identity, childhood, food, travels.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gokarting at Circuit of the Americas, which I wrote a little bit on in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://j-fang.github.io/adventures/2019/07/02/lean-into-that-fear.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Barton Creek Greenbelt trail – nature. beautiful. go see it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fredericksburg + peach picking. It was a hot day trip with my coworkers. We ambled through random shops. I wished to have seen more, but at least half the people I went with didn’t have similar shopping tastes as me, so I didn’t want to hold them back. :P&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wander through the streets and neighborhoods of East Austin, Burnet Road, Downtown, S Lamar, South Congress, West Campus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attended a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bookpeople.com/&quot;&gt;BookPeople&lt;/a&gt; Well-Read Black Girl book club event and an author event with Elaine Welteroth, associated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spent hours at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bookpeople.com/&quot;&gt;BookPeople&lt;/a&gt; to read books.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve actually stayed consistent with catching up with calling family and friends. Will call at least 3 different people each week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I like it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty satisfied with my summer so far (outside of work. inside of work is another story that I will touch on later). I’m doing the things I want to do: spending time with people who make me smile and laugh; staying in touch with my family and friends; working on a cool project that I’m really excited to launch later this year; exploring a new city at a comfortable pace; going to my local farmers’ markets; managing to feed myself well and exercise regularly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="lifestyle" /><summary type="html">As of 7/7/2019, I am 5 weeks into my summer here in Austin.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Local transport rocks.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/adventures/2019/07/07/local-transport-rocks.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Local transport rocks." /><published>2019-07-07T03:05:25-05:00</published><updated>2019-07-07T03:05:25-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/adventures/2019/07/07/local-transport-rocks</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/adventures/2019/07/07/local-transport-rocks.html">&lt;p&gt;I discovered the Austin bus system!! Now my exploration zone has expanded by a 5 mile radius. I’m so freaking excited and happy about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, I walked everywhere, and I enjoyed it; it’s how I travel and discover new places when I am in a new city. I’m willing to walk 40 minutes to get to a destination, given time permits. However, in the first few weeks I’ve been here, I kind of maxed out seeing all that I am interested in the Austin West Campus and downtown area, given the heat and humidity of the summer. I also adventured a bit of East Austin and South Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t like taking Ubers or Lyfts because 1) I’m frugal and don’t like spending so much money on transportation and 2) I don’t like traveling with car. I don’t see or experience much of a new place that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the bus, it’s $2.50 for a 24 hour pass, and it will take me close to any destination I’ve wanted to go to so far. They have an app that makes it super convenient to purchase and use tickets. Google Maps has been immensely helpful in figuring out what buses to take and how to get to location X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus has enabled me to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) stroll through the Barton Creek Greenbelt trails (to spend some time in nature and outdoors)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) shop leisurely through Burnet Road (and discover Wheatesville Coop, a local grocery store that I am excited to now support)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) shorten my morning farmers’ market trips, and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) venture through S Lamar where there are many yummy restaurants that I want to try out one day.&lt;/p&gt;

He would pick fake fights with family friends. On his first time on the ice rink, he skated as if he were a natural. He was the only one in the family to dare ride a roller coaster, and because my dad’s love for him was greater than his fear, my dad rode with him (after that ride in Universal Studios, both were like, “that was too scary…”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, on the other hand, played it safe. I was obedient, followed my elder’s rules and instructions to a T. I remember. Once on a field trip to a museum, the chaperone of my group instructed us to follow her so we wouldn’t get lost. What that means is keep an eye on the group and stick with it. For me, I just follow-the-leadered her, trailing her into the bathroom to wash her hands and as she meandered while we were waiting for entry into the museum. She laughed and told me she didn’t mean I literally had to follow her, and I remember thinking to myself, “You said to follow you though…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think part of my personality was due to my parents working all the time. Every time they dropped off my brother and I at my grandma’s house, they would remind us to love each other and watch out for each other. Knowing the stress my parents carried to afford our humble lifestyle, I took those words to heart, and I assumed a more parental role over my brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has hindered me in many ways, some of which I still struggle with right now. However, one thing that I have taken away from these experiences is to lean into my fears. I’ve been presented with opportunities that sound very exciting. My immediate response is, “I want to do that!” However, when I am actually given the opportunity to do it, I tell myself, “I can’t. I’m scared.” But then I see my brother do it, and I’m like, “Come on. If he can do it, I should be able to do it too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no pivoting moment where I realized this. It’s been a slow change I’ve been tackling since high school. And I’ve noticed it more recently in my conversations with people and the activities I’ve pursued in my summer life at Austin, TX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past weekend, I went gokarting with a crew of Cloudflare employees and co-interns. I had a lot of fun through the heat and sweat. First, I felt so cool driving the gokart. How can you not when you wear such a large helmet and drive at seemingly high speeds with loud car engine noises? And when you pass other racers (that happened only twice for me)? That’s the best part, haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also discovered another world. The technique and strategy to braking and gassing the gokart requires skill! My ego got the best of me after a good 2nd race (we raced 3 races in total), and I spun out way too many times by gassing too much on my 3rd race, placing dead last (very humbling).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I noticed in my interactions with the group was that 3 out of the 5 people asked me if I had fun. They didn’t ask that question to anyone else, not that I heard of at least. I don’t know what that means. My hypothesis is that 1) I’m a female, 2) I was not very talkative (that’s in my nature, but I don’t think I talked significantly less compared to the others), 3) it was coincidence, or 4) some other reason. I was very aware that I was the only female in the group. My mom noticed it immediately too when I sent her a photo of the crew. I don’t think it’s worth thinking too much about, but it did bother me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What provoked me to write on this is 1) to share my adventure (since this category is lacking so far) and 2) a cointern had made a side comment on how I’m risk taking (I forgot his exact word choice). And I just wanted to share: my immediate response to the gokarting event was like, “heck yea, I want to do it! sounds fun.” But my mind was telling me, “it seems kinda scary to drive at 55mph though…” I didn’t respond to the group chat until a week after when they were finalizing ticket purchases when I told myself, “Being scared is not a good reason not to do something.” So I let them know I wanted to join. I don’t self-describe myself as a risk taker, but I am intentional about accepting opportunities that are available to me that I’m interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t lean into everything though. One thing I won’t do is bungee jump, because I have no interest in doing so (not because I’m scared. I am scared, but I would push myself to do it if I had any interest.) It’s not easy to lean in. It takes intention, determination, and consciousness, but it’s all worth it in the end.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="adventures" /><summary type="html">My brother was always the risk taker. He would pick fake fights with family friends. On his first time on the ice rink, he skated as if he were a natural. He was the only one in the family to dare ride a roller coaster, and because my dad’s love for him was greater than his fear, my dad rode with him (after that ride in Universal Studios, both were like, “that was too scary…”).</summary></entry></feed>
