    <p>My brother was always the risk taker. He would pick fake fights with family friends. On his first time on the ice rink, he skated as if he were a natural. He was the only one in the family to dare ride a roller coaster, and because my dad’s love for him was greater than his fear, my dad rode with him (after that ride in Universal Studios, both were like, “that was too scary…”).</p>

<p>I, on the other hand, played it safe. I was obedient, followed my elder’s rules and instructions to a T. I remember. Once on a field trip to a museum, the chaperone of my group instructed us to follow her so we wouldn’t get lost. What that means is keep an eye on the group and stick with it. For me, I just follow-the-leadered her, trailing her into the bathroom to wash her hands and as she meandered while we were waiting for entry into the museum. She laughed and told me she didn’t mean I literally had to follow her, and I remember thinking to myself, “You said to follow you though…”</p>

<p>I think part of my personality was due to my parents working all the time. Every time they dropped off my brother and I at my grandma’s house, they would remind us to love each other and watch out for each other. Knowing the stress my parents carried to afford our humble lifestyle, I took those words to heart, and I assumed a more parental role over my brother.</p>

<p>This has hindered me in many ways, some of which I still struggle with right now. However, one thing that I have taken away from these experiences is to lean into my fears. I’ve been presented with opportunities that sound very exciting. My immediate response is, “I want to do that!” However, when I am actually given the opportunity to do it, I tell myself, “I can’t. I’m scared.” But then I see my brother do it, and I’m like, “Come on. If he can do it, I should be able to do it too.”</p>

<p>There is no pivoting moment where I realized this. It’s been a slow change I’ve been tackling since high school. And I’ve noticed it more recently in my conversations with people and the activities I’ve pursued in my summer life at Austin, TX.</p>

<p>This past weekend, I went gokarting with a crew of Cloudflare employees and co-interns. I had a lot of fun through the heat and sweat. First, I felt so cool driving the gokart. How can you not when you wear such a large helmet and drive at seemingly high speeds with loud car engine noises? And when you pass other racers (that happened only twice for me)? That’s the best part, haha.</p>

<p>I also discovered another world. The technique and strategy to braking and gassing the gokart requires skill! My ego got the best of me after a good 2nd race (we raced 3 races in total), and I spun out way too many times by gassing too much on my 3rd race, placing dead last (very humbling).</p>

<p>One thing that I noticed in my interactions with the group was that 3 out of the 5 people asked me if I had fun. They didn’t ask that question to anyone else, not that I heard of at least. I don’t know what that means. My hypothesis is that 1) I’m a female, 2) I was not very talkative (that’s in my nature, but I don’t think I talked significantly less compared to the others), 3) it was coincidence, or 4) some other reason. I was very aware that I was the only female in the group. My mom noticed it immediately too when I sent her a photo of the crew. I don’t think it’s worth thinking too much about, but it did bother me.</p>

<p>What provoked me to write on this is 1) to share my adventure (since this category is lacking so far) and 2) a cointern had made a side comment on how I’m risk taking (I forgot his exact word choice). And I just wanted to share: my immediate response to the gokarting event was like, “heck yea, I want to do it! sounds fun.” But my mind was telling me, “it seems kinda scary to drive at 55mph though…” I didn’t respond to the group chat until a week after when they were finalizing ticket purchases when I told myself, “Being scared is not a good reason not to do something.” So I let them know I wanted to join. I don’t self-describe myself as a risk taker, but I am intentional about accepting opportunities that are available to me that I’m interested in.</p>

<p>I don’t lean into everything though. One thing I won’t do is bungee jump, because I have no interest in doing so (not because I’m scared. I am scared, but I would push myself to do it if I had any interest.) It’s not easy to lean in. It takes intention, determination, and consciousness, but it’s all worth it in the end.</p>

        <p>I’ve put off writing this blog for years.  Because I&#39;ve been stressing over making myself sound like I know my stuff. But I&#39;m not perfect. I&#39;m trialing through life, just as everybody else is.  And I’m trying to embrace this by  finally just doing what I’ve been wanting to do:  processing and sharing my thoughts through written words, unfiltered.  </p>
