    <p>I’ve been protecting myself by not checking the news. I know there’s a lot of not so good things happening due to the coronavirus, and I think the magnitude of it all is greater than I comprehend right now. However, for my own mental health, I’ve been doing my own thing at home. Newsletters from people I admire and respect, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and occasionally the local Chinese news have been my news source, which I check 1-2 times a day.</p>

<p>I realized that I’ve surrounded myself with people who are serving others and amplifying the incredible people around the world who are serving others. With that, I’m still filled with hope and positivity from all the positive activities I’m virtually surrounded by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people are connecting with others. we’re spending time with families, finding ways to connect with friends, learning to check in on people we know.</li>
  <li>communities are stepping up. in my neighborhood, people are offering to help older people purchase goods, share information about what’s still available where, share resources and offer services for those who are in need.</li>
  <li>music. dnice’s homeschool (aka club quarantine). singers’ free concerts on Insta.</li>
  <li>food. chefs are cooking in their homes and sharing the experience and lessons with others. many chefs and organizations are offering free meals to the community. schools are offering free meals for children and families.</li>
  <li>love for farmers. so many people are finding ways to support their local farmers directly. farmers are still farming. they’re literally the heart and blood of our food system, bless them.</li>
  <li>with so many people off roads, not traveling in planes, not outside (and littering), our air is cleaner. waters are cleaner.</li>
  <li>downtime. we’re conditioned to feel like we have to always be busy, doing something. and i think this is an important time to give ourselves a break, relax, take care of ourselves.</li>
  <li>people are caring for personal health. exercising. cooking for themselves. reading. journaling. spending time with others. dancing. singing. and so much more.</li>
  <li>more and more attention, respect, and gratitude for all our service workers and how integral they are to our daily lives. the number of funds and donations to support those impacted by the pandemic is on the up and up.</li>
  <li>heathcare providers. massive gratitude to them and all they do.</li>
</ul>

        <p>I’ve put off writing this blog for years.  Because I&#39;ve been stressing over making myself sound like I know my stuff. But I&#39;m not perfect. I&#39;m trialing through life, just as everybody else is.  And I’m trying to embrace this by  finally just doing what I’ve been wanting to do:  processing and sharing my thoughts through written words, unfiltered.  </p>
